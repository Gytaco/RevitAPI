RevitAPI
========

Basic VSTA and VS Studio code heavily commented for new users to learn how to use the Revit API


This is a repository for those learning the Revit API, Revit Macros and Dynamo Scripts, it will be updated as I continue to work on bits & pieces and the key feature will be making sure the code is heavily commented for new users to understand.

At the moment the document should be read in conjunction with the handouts I did for RTC Australia and RTC USA, I will work out how to get this data across in an easier format.

Before doing anything please install the revit SDK from either the Revit installation or from online.

Last notice, if you plan to use any or all of this code please check out the licence conditions, they are pretty easy to abide by :)

Anything in here so far I have to credit [Jeremy Tammik](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/) and [Harry Matthison](http://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/) as I have certainly used their code or parts of it for many of the examples listed.
