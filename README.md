RevitAPI
========

Basic VSTA and VS Studio code heavily commented for new users to learn how to use the Revit API


This is a repository for those learning the Revit API, Revit Macros and Dynamo Scripts, it will be updated as I continue to work on bits & pieces and the key feature will be making sure the code is heavily commented for new users to understand.

At the moment the document should be read in conjunction with the handouts I did for RTC Australia and RTC USA, I will work out how to get this data across in an easier format.

Stay tuned the initial code sets will be out soon!!!
