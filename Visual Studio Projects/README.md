Visual Studio Projects
======

This is where entire projects are kept.

Each project file contains a .csproj file and will do various things.
As people create their own I hope they will share them and we can all help each other creating new stuff.

The Learning Folder has some basic exercises from the handouts and also completed "newcommand" and "Application" Visual project to enable users to create their own UI's or simple commands rather then just using Macro's.

THe UI Folder has a simple project showing how a user can create a list using WPF format.

Other folders will be created and code shared as the need arises.
